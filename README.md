# Motivate Me

### Overview

Motivate Me is a React based Time Management App that uses MongoDB to store user information. This application was designed to list and schedule tasks, keep track of corresponding due dates, and help the user manage their time and efforts more efficiently. In order to do this, Motivate Me gives the user access to four key features: a task list, a calendar, an overview user stas, and a pomorodor timer.

Task List This application stores each of the user's tasks and lets them sort them in specific ways. Each task is organized in to one of six categories (Personal, Career, Health, Fitness, Chores, and Education). In addition, the user can specify each task's level of importance, input a due-date, and mark it as completed whenever the user feels it is appropriate.

### Calendar

The calendar provided is automatically updated with the user's task information whenever a new task is submitted. The calendar shows when a task was created, when it is due to be competed, and lets the user keep track of their schedule and organize their efforts.

### Pomodoro Timer

The pomodoro timer is a method of time management that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, and separates each session with a short break. Our timer is completely customizable to meet your productivity goals--set the length of each session and break to whatever you like. Start by deciding on a task you'd like to complete, set the timers, work until you are hear a notification, then get back to work after a short break. Rinse and repeat.

### Stats Page

Motivate Me also gives its users access to individual stats. Clicking on the User Stats page will bring you to a graph that will illustrate just how much time you've spent on each category of a task. The graph shows how many tasks in each category have been completed, how many are being worked on currently, and lets the user see where they devote most of their efforts.
